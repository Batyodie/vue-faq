			<h1>Progressive Web Applications</h>
			<p>In this chapter, we will see the next evolutionary step for web applications: <b>progressive web applications</b> (<b>PWAs</b>). This term may not seem descriptive enough, but it refers to a group of technologies that create the general concept and can be implemented gradually or partially. The basic idea behind it is to bring a web application out of the context of the browser and implement it in any type of device, to act and behave as much as possible to a native application. This is done thanks to the implementation of new APIs in the browser engines, as well as integrations among the most popular operating systems for desktop and mobile devices. The starting point for a PWA is, of course, a <b>single-page </b><b>application</b></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><b>SPA</b></span><span class="No-Break">).</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, we will have learned the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What makes a SPA a PWA, and which technologies are involved</li>
				<li>How to implement manually a responsive SPA, manifest file, service workers, offline storage, and so on</li>
				<li>What<i> service </i><i>workers </i></span><span class="No-Break">are</li>
				<li>How to use Vite plugins to automate the creation of PWAs</li>
				<li>How to test the readiness of your application using <i>Google Lighthouse</i></li>
			</ul>
			<p>From the preceding list, we will concentrate on learning the scaffolding for several technologies, setting the foundation to use them later, implemented in detail in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/vue-js-3-design/9781803238074/B18602_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173"><i>Chapter 7</i></span></a>,<i> Data Flow Management</i>, and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/vue-js-3-design/9781803238074/B18602_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor186"><span class="No-Break"><i>Chapter 8</i></span></a>, <i>Multithreading with Web Workers</i>. By the end of these chapters, you will know how to create PWAs that make good use of today’s computing power, making them responsive, reliable, <span class="No-Break">and performant.</p>
			<h2>Technical requirements</h2>
			<p>In order to follow along with this chapter, you will need the code examples found in the repository at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Vue.js-3-Design-Patterns-and-Best-Practices/tree/main/Chapter06">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Vue.js-3-Design-Patterns-and-Best-Practices/tree/main/Chapter06</a>. The text code examples in this section may not be enough to create a working example, without the additional code from the repository.</p>

			<h2>PWAs or installable SPAs</h2>
			<p>A PWA is not a single setting or technology, but a systematic enhancement of a web application to comply with certain conditions, be it either a <b>multi-page application</b> (<b>MPA</b>) or a SPA. However, they really shine and come to life when these technologies are applied to SPAs, giving us powerful applications that blend the line between online/offline and desktop or web. The term <b>progressive</b> used here has the same connotation as we have discussed previously when applied to the Vue framework—an incremental application of web technologies.</p>
			<p>PWAs are then treated somehow specially by the browsers and the operating system. They can be installed alongside native or desktop applications and manage network communications (to send, receive, cache files, and even push notifications from the server). At this point, it is important to note that we are no longer referring only to desktop computers but also to mobile devices such as tablets and phones, and different operating systems. It is because of this multiplatform approach that special consideration needs to be taken if the intention is to cover a user base on different devices, such as the use of special and dedicated CSS rules to adapt the UI to different sizes (the so-called <b>responsive applications</b>), different icons, and colors to blend with local user customizations at the operating system level (for example, light and dark modes), and so on. Moreover, PWAs have the capacity (just as with SPAs) to store content for offline use and, hopefully, should also provide some functionality for offline use. To accomplish all of this, at the bare minimum, a PWA must comply with the following requirements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The web application must be served through a secure connection (HTTPS).</li>
				<li>The application must provide a manifest file.</li>
				<li>It must provide and install a service worker.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When all these conditions are met, the browser or operating system may prompt the user to “install” the application. If the user accepts, the manifest file will be used to customize the appearance of the application to match the local operating system (icons, names, colors, and so on), and it will appear alongside all the other applications in the system. When run, it will open in its own window (if so selected) outside the confines of the web browser, just as with a regular native application. Internally, it will still run over the browser engine using web technologies, but the intent is that this will be transparent for the user, providing the best of both worlds. Chances are that a user may have been using PWAs instead of regular applications without knowing. Successful examples of this approach are Starbucks, Trivago, and Tinder (</span><a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani/a-tinder-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-78919d98ece0"><span class="No-Break">https://medium.com/@addyosmani/a-tinder-progressive-web-app-performance-case-study-78919d98ece0</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</p>
			<p>This creates a good number of advantages that overpower the complications of creating a web application to match the different installation scenarios:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>One single code base to install an application on multiple devices (desktop, mobile, …) and operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and so on)</li>
				<li>Support push notifications from the server, manual handling of caching, offline use, and so on</li>
				<li>They integrate with the local operating system</li>
				<li>Updates are transparent for the user and are much faster than a traditional application
(for the most part)</li>
				<li>Developing a PWA incurs much fewer costs than the equivalent targeted individual applications for each platform</li>
				<li>One can use all available web technologies, frameworks, and libraries</li>
				<li>Can be indexed by search engines, and the distribution and installation do not depend on proprietary application stores</li>
				<li>They are responsive, safe, and fast, and can be shared with just a link</li>
				<li>You can access local devices using standard web APIs, such as the local filesystem and USB devices, use hardware accelerated graphics, and so on</li>
				<li>Some proprietary application stores allow you to re-package your PWA and distribute it as a regular application (Microsoft Store, Amazon Store, Android Store, and so on)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are more advantages, but these may be enough to make our case for them. Also, it is easier to add the necessary elements to our SPA to make it a PWA. This may make PWAs look like the silver bullet of applications; however, there are a few caveats and drawbacks to consider as well:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The performance of a PWA is good but will always fall behind a native application for certain specific scenarios. The same may happen in older hardware—they will run, but performance may suffer.</li>
				<li>Apple devices fall a little behind in the adoption of some web technologies or limit them purposely for PWAs (for example, server push notifications).</li>
				<li>There’s a need to dedicate a bit more effort to cover different user experience scenarios on multiple devices (but slightly more than for a normal responsive web application).</li>
				<li>Some application stores will not allow PWAs (specifically at the time of this writing, the Apple App Store). Also, the application will not benefit from the exposure and <i>foot traffic</i> from an app store.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Overall, the advantages outweigh considerably the disadvantages. As web technologies continue to advance, PWAs benefit more from them and become more ubiquitous. Now, with a better understanding of what a PWA is and what it can do, let’s upgrade our SPAs into PWAs.</p>
			<h2>Upscaling a SPA into a PWA</h2>
			<p>The first requirement mentioned previously is to serve the application over a secure connection. We will see how to accomplish this by installing a free SSL certificate in our server using <b>Let’s Encrypt</b>, in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/vue-js-3-design/9781803238074/B18602_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor224"><i>Chapter 10</i></span></a>, <i>Deploying Your Application</i>. With that in mind, let’s see how to fulfil the <span class="No-Break">other requirements.</p>
			<h3>The manifest file</h3>
			<p>Adding a manifest file is the starting point to turn our application into a PWA. It is nothing less than a J<a id="_idTextAnchor155"></a>SON file with well-known fields that instruct the browser or operating system on how the application should be installed on the desktop or mobile device. This file must appear linked in the <b>head</b> section of our <b>index.html</b> file, and while it could be arbitrarily named, the convention is to use the name <b>manifest.json</b> or <b>app.webmanifest</b>. The official specification suggests the <b>.webmanifest</b> extension, but at the same type clarifies that the name is not really important as long as the file is received properly with the <b>application/manifest+json - </b><b>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions</b> (<b>MIME</b>) type (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/">https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/</a>, section <i>§1.1.2</i>).  In our code examples, we will use the name <b>manifest.json</b> for simplicity:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">&lt;link rel="<b>manifest</b>" href="<b>/manifest.json"</b>&gt;</pre>
			<p>Notice from the previous code that the file is placed at the root of our application, and the <b>rel</b> attribute must be <b>manifest</b>. The field attributes in our manifest file can appear in any order, and all of them are considered <i>o<a id="_idTextAnchor156"></a>ptional</i> by the aforementioned specification. However, some platforms do expect a minimum set of attributes that we will consider <i>necessary</i>. The common practice also demands other attribute<a id="_idTextAnchor157"></a>s that we will catalogue as <i>recommended</i>, and finally, some attributes in the specification are used often in app stores, social media, and so on to present or describe the application, so we will refer to these as <i>descriptive</i> fields. This classification is n<a id="_idTextAnchor158"></a>ot part of the specifications but is useful to guide you in the implementation. Here is a list of the most common and useful attributes:</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 6.1 – Manifest fields</p>
			<p>In practice, I would recommend that the necessary and recommended fields are completed for each PWA, while the descriptive fields are used as needed based on the context of your application. Additionally, research your target platforms for additional supported fields that are not part of the standard specification.</p>
			<p>Following the preceding table, here is an example of a <b>manifest.json</b></span><span class="No-Break"> file:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"short_name":"PWA Example",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Chapter 6: Progressive Web Application Example",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"start_url":"/",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"display": "standalone",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"theme_color":"#2979FF",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"background_color":"#000",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"orientation": "portrait"
}</pre>
			<p>As you can see, creating a manifest file is not much additional effort and is an easy addition to our SPA.</p>
			<h3>Testing your manifest</h3>
			<p>Once you have created your manifest file and linked it to your <b>index.html</b> file, you can use the Developer Tools in a browser to check that it has been properly loaded. For example, when using Google Chrome, in the <b>Application</b> menu, we can see here that the example file has been properly loaded:</p>
			<div>
				<div>
					<img src="images/Figure_6.01_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1 – Developer Tools on Google Chrome, showing the manifest file" width="1098" height="488">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.1 – Developer Tools on Google Chrome, showing the manifest file</p>
			<p>However, there is one more topic related to the installation of the application that we must review: when and how does the user know that the web application can be installed? This is where the <i>Install prompt</i> comes into play, which we will see next.</p>
			<h3>Install prompt</h3>
			<p>Each platform (mobile or desktop) has its own method of determining when a PWA that meets the installation criteria can be installed. This could trigger a notification for the user to accept the installation after a certain amount of time, or only provide a UI to do so. On mobile devices, the installed PWA will be placed on the home screen alongside other native applications, while on a desktop, it may be placed inside the browser and/or also in the main menu. Also, in mobile operating systems such as Android, a splash screen will be automatically created with the theme and background colors and the application icon provided in the manifest. Independently of how and when the PWA can be installed, it is important to know that it can only be done with the user’s consent and initiative. We cannot trigger the installation automatically from the code without the user’s approval.</p>
			<p>The basic installation flow is as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>When the platform detects that our application can be installed, it will trigger an event in the window object called <b>beforeinstallprompt</b>. We can cache this event to trigger the prompt later from our application.</li>
				<li>The user initiates the install either through the platform UI or through our PWA-provided method (such as a button).</li>
				<li>The platform will prompt the user to accept or reject the installation.</li>
				<li>If the user accepts, it will install the PWA and trigger another event named </span><span class="No-Break"><b>appinstalled</b></span><span class="No-Break">.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is a rather simple workflow. However, the <b>beforeinstallprompt</b> event is triggered only once, so if the user rejects the installation, we need to wait until the browser triggers the event again.</p>
			<p>Now<a id="_idTextAnchor162"></a> that we understand how things will work, it is time to see this in code. Consider that in our Vue 3 component’s template, we have the following elements:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">&lt;p v-show="<b>_install_ready &amp;&amp; !_app_installed"</b>&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Install this app
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;button @click="<b>installPWA()</b>"&gt;Install&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p v-show="<b>_app_installed"</b>&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive Web Application installed
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
			<p>As you can see, we have two paragraphs that will show according to the value of the <b>_install_ready </b>and <b>_app_installed</b> reactive variables, both Boolean. The first will appear when the PWA is ready to be installed and will provide a button to trigger the installation through the <b>installPWA()</b> function. The second will show once it has been performed.</p>
			<p>Our code in the script section is also rather straightforward:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">import { onMounted, ref, onBeforeUnmount } from 'vue'
const
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_install_ready=ref(false),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_install_prompt=ref(null),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_app_installed=ref(false)
// Detect PWA installable
onMounted(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.addEventListener("<b>beforeinstallprompt</b>",savePrompt)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.addEventListener("<b>appinstalled</b>",handleAppInstalled)})
function savePrompt(event){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event.preventDefault(); // Prevents mobile prompt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Save reference to the event, to activate it later
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>_install_prompt.value=event</b>;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Notify UI that the application can be installed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_install_ready.value=true;
}
function installPWA(){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Trigger the installation prompt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(_install_prompt.value){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>_install_prompt.value.prompt()</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
function handleAppInstalled(){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_install_prompt.value=null;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_app_installed.value=true;
}</pre>
			<p>In the previous code, we register two listeners when our component is mounted on the page, one to manage and cache the installation prompt, and another to detect when the application has been installed. Some parts have been omitted to keep the code simple, but the full component with styles can be found in the GitHub repository.</p>
			<p>While the preceding example is rather simplistic, there are some well-known patterns to promote or introduce the installation option to the end user. They all rely on the same logic of capturing the event and pr<a id="_idTextAnchor165"></a>ompting it later while showing the trigger element. The implementation is trivial and has more to do with design than a coding pattern, so we will <a id="_idTextAnchor166"></a>only see the mock-ups here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Simple <b>Install</b> button (as in our example application):</li>

			<p>Once the application has been installed, we want to prevent keeping prompting the user for an install. In this case, it is recommendable that we save the offline flag, in <b>localStorage</b>, a cookie, on <b>indexeDB,</b> or mark the start URL of our application to a specific location. We will <a id="_idTextAnchor167"></a>see offline persistent storage options in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/vue-js-3-design/9781803238074/B18602_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173"><i>Chapter 7</i></span></a>, <i>Data Flow Management</i>. Now, it’s time to look at the last item to make our SPA a true PWA: <span class="No-Break">service workers.</p>
			<h2>Service workers</h2>
			<p>A service worker is a JavaScript script that runs on a separate thread, as a background process to your application. It acts like a proxy for the network, intercepting all calls and behaving according to a programmed strategy to serve pages and data.</p>
			<p>We can have multiple service workers as each one is responsible for their scope. The scope is defined as the directory (URL path) where the source file for the service worker is located. Thus, a service worker placed at the root of the application will handle the entire SPA/PWA.</p>
			<p>Service workers are installed without user intervention, so they can be used even if the user does not install the PWA. They have a well-defined life cycle (see https://web.dev/service-worker-lifecycle/), triggering events for each accomplished state. To start, a service worker needs to be first <i>registered</i>, then it becomes <i>activated</i>, and eventually, we can also <i>unregister</i> it. Once the service worker is activated, it will not take control of the application communication until the next time the site is accessed.</p>
			<p>The most common strategies to program a service worker are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Serve the cache only</li>
				<li>Serve network only</li>
				<li>Try to serve the cache first, fall back to the network</li>
				<li>Try to serve the network first, fall back to the cache</li>
				<li>Serve the cache first, update the cache next</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When considering the cache and offline strategies, we need to consider what are the files and assets that our application needs to run that will have little or no change, to cache them. We also need to identify routes that should never be cached.</p>
			<p>To use a service worker, we register it in our <b>main.js</b> file with the following lines:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">if(navigator.serviceWorker){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;navigator.serviceWorker.register("/service_worker.js")
}</pre>
			<p>In these lines, we first test if the current browser has capabilities to use service workers, and if so, we register it. As we can see, we have placed the worker at the root. For this example, we will use a cache-first, network-fallback strategy manually for all network calls:</p>
			<pre class="source-code"><b>// Set strategy, cache first, then network</b>
const CACHE_NAME="MyCache"
self.addEventListener("fetch", event=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>// Intercepts the event to respond</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event.respondWith((async ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>// Try to find the request in the cache</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const found=await caches.match(event.request);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(found){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return found;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}else{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>// Not cached fount, fall back to the network</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const response=await fetch(event.request);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>// Open the cache</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const cache=await caches.open(CACHE_NAME);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>// Place the network response in the cache</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cache.put(event.request, response.clone());
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>// Return the response</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return response;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;})())
})</pre>
			<p>The previous code is based almost verbose on the example provided in the <b>Mozilla Developer Network</b> documentation at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Offline_Service_workers">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Offline_Service_workers</a>. The comments in the code will help you understand the logic for the implementation of the strategy. However, using the basic APIs available to the service worker can be cumbersome, if not verbose. Instead, it is more convenient to use a framework or library to handle them and implement more complex strategies. The standard today is to use <b>Workbox</b>, made by <b>Google</b> (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/). We will not use it directly, but through a Vite plugin that we will see in the next section.</p>
			<p>With all the code seen thus far, our PWA is ready to work and be installed. If we run the example application in the development server, we will notice that it can be installed. Using either the browser UI or our <b>Install</b> button, we will receive the following prompt:</p>
			<div>
				<div>
					<img src="images/Figure_6.06_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 6.6 – PWA install prompt from localhost" width="758" height="200">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.6 – PWA install prompt from localhost</p>
			<p>Adapting manually our SPA to turn it into a PWA is not complicated, but it does require some manual work. However, with the choice of tools we have, we can do better. There is an easier way to generate and inject both the manifest file and service worker as part of our workflow directly into our SPA: using a Vite plugin.</p>
			<h2>Vite-PWA plugin</h2>
			<p>In the Vite ecosystem of plugins, there is an excellent zero-configuration Vite-PWA plugin (<a href="https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/">https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/</a>). Out of the box, it provides us with great functionality without much manual work. We install the plugin as a developer dependency with the following command in the terminal:</p>
			<pre class="console">$ npm install –-save-dev vite-plugin-pwa</pre>
			<p>Once it has been installed, we must register it in the Vite configuration. Modify the </span><span class="No-Break"><b>vite.config.js</b>
file to match the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import { <b>VitePWA </b>} from 'vite-plugin-pwa'
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [
vue(),
<b>VitePWA</b>({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>registerType</b>: "autoUpdate",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>injectRegister</b>: 'auto',
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>devOptions</b>: { enabled:true },
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>workbox</b>: {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg}']
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>includeAssets</b>:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;['fonts/*.ttf','images/*.png','css/*.css'],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>manifest</b>: {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"short_name": "PWA Example",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Chapter 6 - Progressive Web Application Example",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"start_url": "/",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"display": "standalone",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"theme_color": "#333333",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"background_color": "#000000",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"orientation": "portrait",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"icons": [
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"src": "/images/chapter_6_icon_192x192.png",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"sizes": "192x192",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "image/png"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"src": "/images/chapter_6_icon.png",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"sizes": "512x512",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "image/png"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"src": "/images/chapter_6_icon.png",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"sizes": "512x512",

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"purpose":"maskable"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"prefer_related_applications": false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;})]
})</pre>
			<p>Using this plugin, we unload the burden of generating the service worker and web manifest to the bundler. This is necessary since with each production build, Vite will generate different filenames for each script according to our strategy to lazy load components, as we discussed in the previous chapter.</p>
			<p>In the preceding example, we pass into the <b>VitePWA()</b> plugin an object with some sensible options for the automatic creation and injection of our manifest and worker. If we need finer control over the service worker strategy created, as well as with the web manifest, it is possible to use the plugin in “inject mode” and provide a base file for our service worker. In this case, the script will be injected with the generated files from the build process. Underneath, this plugin uses <b>Workbox</b>, a tool that we mentioned before and that we can customize directly through the <b>workbox</b> field. Going further into the details of the different implementations and strategies goes beyond the scope of this book, but the reader should consult the documentation about the <b>Vite-PWA</b> plugin and <b>Workbox</b> for specific contexts and use cases.</p>
			<h2>Testing your PWA score with Google Lighthouse</h2>
			<p>Chrome-based browsers provide together with the developer tools a utility called Lighthouse, specifically designed to test and rate web pages, and the readiness of PWAs. To access this tool, after you have opened your application in the browser, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the developer tools (by pressing <i>F12</i> in Windows/Linux, <i>Fn</i> + <i>F12</i> in Mac, or through the browser menu).</li>
				<li>Click the <b>Lighthouse</b> menu toward the further right.</li>
				<li>Select <b>Mobile</b> or <b>Desktop</b>, plus make sure the <b>Progressive Web App</b> category is checked.</li>
				<li>Click <b>Analyze page load</b> in the top-right corner of the tool.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The developer tools should look something like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div>
					<img src="images/Figure_6.07_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7 – Lighthouse utility" width="921" height="377">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.7 – Lighthouse utility</p>
			<p>The tool will run a number of tests, and each different category will display a rating, as well as a detailed list of items that have either passed or failed. If our application does not qualify to be a PWA, the items marked in red will tell us why and how to fix them:</p>
			<div>
				<div>
					<img src="images/Figure_6.08_B18602.jpg" alt="Figure 6.8 – Chapter 6 code example ratings in Lighthouse" width="904" height="472">
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.8 – Chapter 6 code example ratings in Lighthouse</p>
			<p>Our example code application fully qualifies as a PWA and passes all tests with flying colors. This is easier to accomplish with smaller applications, of course. In practice, every rating above 90 is great.</p>
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>In this chapter, we have taken a simple SPA and learned how to upgrade it into a PWA, manually and through the use of a plugin in Vite. Users can install PWAs in their platforms alongside native applications and interact with them, even if they are not connected to the internet. PWAs offer many advantages over web-only applications. We also saw how we can measure and rate our application in several industry-standard categories using Lighthouse. With this chapter, we end the incremental building of applications using web technologies and henceforth will focus on patterns and models for internal performance and efficiency.</p>
