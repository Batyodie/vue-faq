<h1>Appendix: Migrating from Vue 2</h1>
			<p>Migrating a Vue 2 application to Vue 3 is not as straightforward as just replacing the framework. While the Options API remains fully compatible and there should not be a need to migrate to the Composition API, there are other breaking changes that we should be aware of.</p>
			<p>The changes between versions affect not only the core framework but also the ecosystem (new router, state management, etc.) and other dependencies. In Vue 3, there is also a new official bundler, <b>Vite</b> (which replaces <b>WebPack</b>), a new router and state management (<b>Pinia</b>, the replacement for <b>Vuex</b>), and other plugins as well. The list of changes included here is a quick reference to help you migrate your application but may not be exhaustive with all the nuances of specific needs for each particular project. Because of this, I will refer you to the official documentation for migration at </span><a href="https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/"><span class="No-Break">https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</p>
			<p>Here is a non-exclusive list of the major changes, other than the new Composition API:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A different way to bootstrap and start the application</li>
				<li>Changes in global components and plugins registration</li>
				<li>Changes in the <b>data</b></span><span class="No-Break"> property</li>
				<li>Changes to <b>v-model</b>, <b>props</b>, and </span><span class="No-Break"><b>emits</b></li>
				<li>Reactivity options</li>
				<li>Framework browser compatibility</li>
				<li>Changes in directory and file organization</li>
				<li>Changes in the router and state management</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This list doesn’t show all the changes <i>under the hood</i> that the framework went through, but it will give you a starting point to migrate your working application from Vue 2 to Vue 3. Now, let’s see each of these in more detail.</p>
			<h2>A different way to bootstrap and start the application</h2>
			<p>The way to bootstrap and start our application has changed. It is now required that we import a constructor from the Vue bundle. Let’s compare both implementations from </span><span class="No-Break"><b>main.js</b></span><span class="No-Break">:</p>
			<p><b>Vue 2 </b><b>application instantiation</b></span><span class="No-Break">:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">import Vue from "vue"
const app=new Vue({el:"#app"})</pre>
			<p>In Vue 2, we import the Vue constructor and pass an object with options. In Vue 3, after the application has been created, we attach components, plugins, and so on before mounting our application to the top-level component. Here is the example rewritten for Vue 3:</p>
			<p><b>Vue 3 </b><b>application instantiation</b></span><span class="No-Break">:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">import {createApp} from "vue"
const app=createApp({..})
app.mount("#app")</pre>
			<p>The location of the <b>index.html</b> file has also changed and is now placed at the root of our application. You can see more changes to the document structure in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/vue-js-3-design/9781803238074/B18602_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079"><i>Chapter 3</i></span></a>, <i>Setting Up a </i><span class="No-Break"><i>Working Project</i></span><span class="No-Break">.</p>
			<h2>Register global components, plugins, and so on</h2>
			<p>In Vue 2, we declare an application-wide component (global) by attaching it to the Vue root instance. Here is an example:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">import Vue from "vue"
import MyComponent from "MyComponent.vue"
<b>vue.component(</b>"myComponent", MyComponent)
const app=new Vue({...})</pre>
			<p>In Vue 3, we instead register components and plugins with the application <i>after</i> it has been created and <i>before</i> it is mounted. The <b>component</b> (for components), <b>use</b> (for plugins), and <b>directive</b> (for directives) methods are all chainable. Here is how the preceding example looks in Vue 3:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">import { createApp }from "vue"
import MyComponent from "MyComponent.vue"
const App=createApp({...})
<b>App.component(</b>"myComponent", MyComponent<b>).mount(</b>"#app"<b>)</b></pre>
			<p>If we do not need to reference the application, we can just concatenate the instantiation of the application as in this example:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">import { createApp }from "vue"
import MyComponent from "MyComponent.vue"
createApp({...}).component("myComponent", MyComponent) .mount("#app")</pre>
			<p>The application bootstrap is independent of the syntax used to describe components (Options API, Composition API, or script setup).</p>
			<h2>The data property is now always a function</h2>
			<p>In Vue 2 applications, there is a discrepancy in the <b>data</b> attribute. The root component has a property that is directly a reactive definition, while all other components need to provide a function that returns an object as the <b>data</b> property. This created an inconsistency in the creation of components. This issue has been resolved in Vue 3, so now <i>all components are treated equally</i>, meaning the data attribute always has to be a function that returns an object whose members will be reactive properties.</p>
			<p>Here is an example of the root component in </span><span class="No-Break"><b>main.js</b></span><span class="No-Break">:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">createApp({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data(){return {...}}
})</pre>
			<p>And then in all other components, you have the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">export default {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data(){return {...}}
}</pre>
			<p>Notice that for these examples, we are using the Options API for clarity. When using the <b>script setup</b> syntax, you do not need to declare a <b>data</b></span><span class="No-Break"> attribute.</p>
			<h2>There are more reactive options to choose from</h2>
			<p>When using the Composition API, we have two options to create reactive properties: <b>ref()</b> and <b>reactive()</b>. The first one returns an object with a <b>.value</b> property<b> </b>that is reactive. The second converts an object passed as an argument and returns the same object with reactive properties. Here is one example:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">&lt;script setup&gt;
import {reactive, ref} from "vue"
const
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data=reactive({name:"John", surname:"Doe"}),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person=ref({name: "Jane", surname:"Doe"})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Then, to access the values in JavaScript
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Reactive object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>data.name="Mary"</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>data.surname="Sue"</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Reactive ref
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>person.value.name="Emma"</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>person.value.surname="Smith"</b>
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;template&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;<b>{{data.surname}}, {{data.name}}</b>&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;{{<b>person.surname</b>}}, {{<b>person.name</b>}}&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;</pre>
			<p>Notice the difference in syntax. At this point, you may think about when to use one or the other. Here is a small comparison of when to use each one:</p>
			<table id="table001-7" class="No-Table-Style _idGenTablePara-1">
				<colgroup>
					<col>
					<col>
				</colgroup>
				<tbody>
					<tr class="No-Table-Style">
						<td class="No-Table-Style">
							<p><b>ref()</b></p>
						</td>
						<td class="No-Table-Style">
							<p><b>reactive()</b></p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="No-Table-Style">
						<td class="No-Table-Style">
							<ul>
								<li>Applies to any data type, not only primitives.</li>
								<li>When applied to objects or arrays, you can replace them.</li>
								<li>It uses getters and setters to detect changes and trigger reactivity.</li>
								<li>Use it by default for simple data. For arrays and objects (complex types), it is recommended to use <b>reactive()</b> when working with their internal elements. When the entire object will be replaced, it is convenient to use </span><span class="No-Break"><b>ref()</b></span><span class="No-Break">.</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
						<td class="No-Table-Style">
							<ul>
								<li>Applies to objects and arrays, but not primitives. Makes their attributes reactive.</li>
								<li>The object cannot be replaced, only its attributes.</li>
								<li>It uses the native implementation of the <b>Proxy()</b> handlers to detect changes and trigger reactivity.</li>
								<li>Use when you need to group a large number of variables that must “travel” together.</li>
							</ul>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table A.1 - A simple guide to choose between ref() and reactive()</p>
			<p>Each method has its own advantages. From the point of view of reactive properties with complex types, it doesn’t matter which one you use. In some cases, <b>reactive()</b> can be more performant due to the use of native implementations in the browser.</p>
			<h2>Changes to v-model, props, and events</h2>
			<p>This is a big change from Vue 2 that can and will break your code. In Vue 3, we no longer receive and emit the property value. Instead, any prop can be input/output, such as <b>v-model</b>. The default <b>v-model</b> attribute is received in a <i>prop</i> named <b>modelValue</b>, and the counterpart <i>emit</i> prepends <b>update:</b>, so it is called </span><span class="No-Break"><b>update:modelValue</b></span><span class="No-Break">.</p>
			<p>In Vue 3, we can now have multiple <i>v-models</i> at the same time. For example, we can have <b>v-model:person="person"</b> in our component, and define the prop as <b>"modelPerson"</b> and the event as </span><span class="No-Break"><b>"update:modelPerson"</b></span><span class="No-Break">.</p>
			<p>Props and emits are now macros (a macro is a special function provided by the bundler or framework). <b>Props</b> have the same footprint as in Vue 2, so you can define them as arrays, objects, include types, default values, and so on.</p>
			<p>Here is an example with a default v-model and a notated model:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">const $props=defineProps(['modelValue','modelPerson']),
$emit=defineEmits(['update:modelValue','update:modelPerson'])</pre>
			<p>Props and emits are discussed in this book in more detail in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/vue-js-3-design/9781803238074/B18602_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor102"><i>Chapter 4</i></span></a>, <i>User Interface Composition </i><span class="No-Break"><i>with Components</i></span><span class="No-Break">.</p>
			<h2>Removed old browser compatibility</h2>
			<p>Vue 3 was built for speed and “modern” JavaScript. Backward compatibility for older browsers has been removed. Many internal functions used for reactivity now use native implementations by default (for example, the Proxy API). If you need to support an application in an outdated browser, you should consider staying with Vue 2, but fear not! There is an official plugin for Vue 2 to use the new <i>Composition API</i>, including the <b>script </b><b>setup</b></span><span class="No-Break"> syntax:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Vue 2.7 includes it without plugins (</span><a href="https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-2-7-naruto.html"><span class="No-Break">https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-2-7-naruto.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">)</li>
				<li>If you are on Vue 2.6 or below, you can find the plugin here: </span><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api"><span class="No-Break">https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api</a></li>
				<li>If you still want the speed of Vue 3, there is a special migration build that has almost the same API as Vue 2 (see </span><a href="https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/migration-build.html"><span class="No-Break">https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/migration-build.html</span></a><span class="No-Break">)</li>
				<li>Why remove old browsers’ compatibility? There are many reasons, including the following:</span><ul><li>The global usage of older browsers has fallen below a significant percentage, and it is expected to continue to drop <span class="No-Break">over time.</span></li><li>With the removal of old code and compatibility checks, the resulting Vue core implementation is lighter and more performant. The increase in speed and reduction in bundle size is significant, making our applications load faster and be <span class="No-Break">more responsive.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In practice, there are two browser engines that take up most of the market: browsers based on Chromium, and ones based on Mozilla Firefox. Check <a href="http://www.caniuse.com/">www.caniuse.com</a> if you need to use a feature that may not be available in older browsers.</p>
			<h2>Changes in directory and file organization</h2>
			<p>The organization for the directory structure in Vue 2 was influenced to some degree by the bundler at the time, <b>WebPack</b>, and the <b>Vue CLI</b>. Now that Vue 3 has moved to <b>Vite</b>, files have been organized to better reflect the development workflow. Such is the case of <b>index.html</b>, which has moved to the root folder out of the <b>Public/</b> folder. It now has a more prominent place in the bundling process. This and other changes appear in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/vue-js-3-design/9781803238074/B18602_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079"><i>Chapter 3</i></span></a>, <i>Setting Up a </i><span class="No-Break"><i>Working Project</i></span><span class="No-Break">.</p>
			<h2>Changes in the router and state management</h2>
			<p>The new approach to components and modularity also affects the router and the state management. While a new version of the router has been provided for Vue 3, the state management’s official solution has moved away from <b>Vuex</b> to <b>Pinia</b>. More information about the new router and Pinia can be found in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/vue-js-3-design/9781803238074/B18602_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130"><i>Chapter 5</i></span></a>, <i>Single-Page Applications</i>, and in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/vue-js-3-design/9781803238074/B18602_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173"><span class="No-Break"><i>Chapter 7</i></span></a>, <i>Data Flow </i><span class="No-Break"><i>Management</i></span><span class="No-Break">, respectively.</p>
			<p>The new router now has a different approach to defining modes, using constructors such as <b>createWebHashHistory</b> (hash mode), <b>createWebHistory</b> (history mode), and <b>createMemoryHistory</b> (navigation in memory alone). This change also affected the configuration of the production bundle. In WebPack, when in history mode, the deployment path was part of the bundler configuration. Now, the path is passed to the constructor as a parameter, being handled completely by the router.</p>
			<h2>New components and other changes</h2>
			<p>Vue 3 also introduces new components such as <b>teleport</b> (a special component that allows placing reactive templates outside the Vue component tree, inside another DOM element), but also breaks free of some limitations in Vue 2. For example, components now can have more than one root element. Please refer to the official documentation to learn more about the new components in Vue 3.</p>
			<h2>Other breaking changes</h2>
			<p>To see a full list of breaking changes not mentioned here, please check the official documentation at </span><a href="https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/breaking-changes/"><span class="No-Break">https://v3-migration.vuejs.org/breaking-changes/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</p>
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Migrating from Vue 2 to Vue 3 has a clear path, with only a few breaking changes to be aware of. The new Composition API however, does require a change of mentality, but it comes naturally when using the <b>script setup</b> syntax. But the most important feature of Vue 3 is the performance gains and the size reduction. In short, Vue 3 is fast, very fast, and well worth the migration. For projects supporting outdated browsers, there are plugins for the Vue 2.x branch that provide some of the advantages of Vue 3, but for other projects seeking the positive gains of Vue 3, it is well worth the migration.</p>
