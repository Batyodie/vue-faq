			</ul>
			<p>Indeed, this has been a long journey, but I’m confident and positive that this content will improve your skills as a developer and professional.</p>
			<h2>Where to go from here</h2>
			<p>Technology keeps advancing daily, so there is much to learn ahead. New tools and patterns are created regularly. Because of this, it is not possible to cover them all in just one book. Often, while preparing a chapter, I’ve been limited to touching on some technologies and concepts only at a surface level due to the scope and breadth of this book. For example, beyond the web, Vue can also be used to develop hybrid applications with tools such as <b>NW.js</b> (<a href="https://nwjs.io/">https://nwjs.io/</a>), <b>Electron </b>(<a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">https://www.electronjs.org/</a>), <b>Tauri</b> (<a href="https://tauri.app/">https://tauri.app/</a>), and more.</p>
			<p>Learning about this framework and the technologies it is based upon will give you important skills.</p>
			<h2>Finally...</h2>
			<p>I express my appreciation for your dedication to this discipline and thank you for purchasing this book. I wish you well and brilliant success in your future endeavors and professional career.</p>
			<p>Sincerely,</p>
