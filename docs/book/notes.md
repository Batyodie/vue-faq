Final words
Congratulations on reaching the end of this book! We have covered a wide spectrum of topics, from the very basics of Vue to the deployment of the final product. Let’s review together the main concepts for each chapter:

In Chapter 1, The Vue 3 Framework, we introduced the key Vue concepts and the different syntax options available for writing components
In Chapter 2, Software Design Principles and Patterns, we took a deep-dive into important conceptual and well-tested patterns for architecting our code
In Chapter 3, Setting Up a Working Project, and Chapter 4, User Interface Composition with Components, we learned how to start a Vue project and how to translate designs into working code
In Chapter 5, Single-Page Applications, and Chapter 6, Progressive Web Applications, possibly the most important chapters, we learned how to create advanced applications with navigation and installation via the browser’s native functions
In Chapter 7, Data Flow Management, and Chapter 8, Multithreading with Web Workers, we learned more about how to improve performance and control the information flow with good practices
Chapter 9, Testing and Source Control, introduced tools to automate programmatic tests to secure the good quality of our code
Chapter 10, Deploying Your Application, gave us a view into the steps and resources needed to publish and secure our server with a secure protocol
Chapter 11, Bonus Chapter - UX Patterns, gave us a view from the user perspective, and a common vocabulary to collaborate with UI/UX designers
Indeed, this has been a long journey, but I’m confident and positive that this content will improve your skills as a developer and professional.

Where to go from here
Technology keeps advancing daily, so there is much to learn ahead. New tools and patterns are created regularly. Because of this, it is not possible to cover them all in just one book. Often, while preparing a chapter, I’ve been limited to touching on some technologies and concepts only at a surface level due to the scope and breadth of this book. For example, beyond the web, Vue can also be used to develop hybrid applications with tools such as NW.js (https://nwjs.io/), Electron (https://www.electronjs.org/), Tauri (https://tauri.app/), and more.

Learning about this framework and the technologies it is based upon will give you important skills.

Finally...
I express my appreciation for your dedication to this discipline and thank you for purchasing this book. I wish you well and brilliant success in your future endeavors and professional career.

Sincerely,

Pablo David Garaguso
