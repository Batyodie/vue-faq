# Hosting

:::: Where to host a website?

After building a frontend project, you get a set of `html/css/js/jpeg` and other static files that need to be hosted on a webserver for your site to be accessed.

Hosting options with free plans:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- [Render](https://render.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Heroku](https://Heroku.com/)
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

Also, many cloud providers (Amazon, Google, Oracle, Microsoft) provide free tariffs with the ability to get a virtual server on which you can install a webserver (Nginx, Apache) and want your site yourself. In this case, the backend can also be placed on it.

:::: details Domain

Buying a domain is now very easy and inexpensive (from 200 rubles per year), so it is recommended to do so. GitHub Pages and other hosts allow you to connect a custom domain to your site. Subdomains are convenient for organizing development environments:

- dev.website.com
- dev-api.website.com
- website.com
- api.website.com
- docs.website.com
