It has a lot of features for localizing dates, numbers, setting the right declensions, RTL language support, downloading locales from the server and a bunch of other things. The i18next site even calls it an &quot;internationalization framework&quot;.</p><p>At the same time, localization of a site often requires very simple things that take up only a couple of percent of the entire functionality of the i18n heavyweight.</p><p>In fact, you usually need a reactive function that returns a string based on the key and the current locale.</p><p>A variant of implementation via composable is in <a href="https://habr.com/ru/articles/736530/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this article</a>.</p><p>Your bundle will be &quot;thinner&quot; by 50Kb.</p></details><details class="details custom-block"><summary>Options API or Composition API?</summary><p>We recommend Composition API (script setup) as more logical and convenient, in which the programmer controls the flow of program execution by means of JavaScript, and not just by setting some magic options.</p></details><details class="details custom-block"><summary>Ref or Reactive?</summary><p>Difference in terms of usage - Reactive only works with objects and does not track object replacement.
